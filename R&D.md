1. Here in the problem statment it was given that we have to run mongo-db on three different ports in so i have considered it as running three instances on same server with port  27017,27018 and 27019.
2. After that i have created folders for storing the data and log file of mongo-db with fork flag so that it runs in background along with replSet flag with rs0.
3. Then done the required configuration
